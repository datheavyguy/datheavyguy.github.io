                  <p>    "I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. 
                      Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door." 
                      - Rick Harrison </p> 
                    <p> Thats what I would say if I were Rick Harrison, but I'm not. I am Brian Prais, welcome to a site about me. I am self taught in python and currently learning 
          Java while expanding my knowledge of python.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If I had a development team, it would probably be called "Better Late than Never" or BLtN for short.</li>
          <li>My spirit animal is a syntax error</li>
          <li>This list is just an artificial website filler</li>
