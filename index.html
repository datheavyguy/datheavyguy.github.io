     <a class="hidden-links" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Harrison"> The whole story</a>
    <p>"I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. 
      Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door." 
      - Rick Harrison </p> 
    <p> Thats what I would say if I were Rick Harrison, but I'm not. I am Brian Prais, welcome to a site about me. I am self taught in python and currently learning 
      Java while expanding my knowledge of python.</p>
    
    <h2>I enjoy:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning,</li>
      <li>Sleeping,</li>
      <li>Eating,</li>
      <li>Not making pointless lists,</li>
      <li> Wasting time,</li>
