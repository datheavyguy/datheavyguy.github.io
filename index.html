    I'm a computer science student who is branching out into multiple disciplines, including a bit of web design, as seen here. 
    <p>I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning,</li>
      <li>Sleeping,</li>
      <li>Eating,</li>
      <li>Not making pointless lists,</li>
      <li> Wasting time,</li>
      <li>Getting fifty syntax errors in ten lines of code,</li>
      <li>Sarcasm</li>
    </ul>
