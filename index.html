    <p>I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. 
      Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door. </p> 
    <h2>I enjoy:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning,</li>
      <li>Sleeping,</li>
      <li>Eating,</li>
      <li>Not making pointless lists,</li>
      <li> Wasting time,</li>
      <li>Getting fifty syntax errors in ten lines of code,</li>
     
    </ul>
